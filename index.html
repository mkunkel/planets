          <li>More than 100 spacecraft been launched to explore the moon. It is the only celestial a body beyond Earth that has been visited by human beings (<a href="">The Apollo Program</a>).</li>
          <li>The moon's weak atmosphere and its lack of liquid water cannot support life as we know it.</li>
          <li>Surface features that create the face known as the "Man in the moon" are impact basins on the moon that are filled with dark basalt rocks.</li>
